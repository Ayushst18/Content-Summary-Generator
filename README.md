# Content-Summary-Generator
As the Content Summary Generator depicts the summarization of the following content, in this project, I have completed the following project (still to do some more future work): When you provide the YouTube content to the front end, you will get the summarized content of the video, whether the following subtitles are present or absent. It is my first project of the MLDL, using the LLM of Gemini Pro for the summarization process.
